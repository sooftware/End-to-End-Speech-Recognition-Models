    Listen, Attend and Spell model with configurable encoder and decoder.

        encoder (torch.nn.Module): encoder of las
        decoder (torch.nn.Module): decoder of las

    Inputs: inputs, input_lengths, targets, teacher_forcing_ratio
        - **inputs** (torch.Tensor): tensor of sequences, whose length is the batch size and within which
          each sequence is a list of token IDs. This information is forwarded to the encoder.
        - **input_lengths** (torch.Tensor): tensor of sequences, whose contains length of inputs.
        - **targets** (torch.Tensor): tensor of sequences, whose length is the batch size and within which
          each sequence is a list of token IDs. This information is forwarded to the decoder.
        - **teacher_forcing_ratio** (float): The probability that teacher forcing will be used. A random number
          is drawn uniformly from 0-1 for every decoding token, and if the sample is smaller than the given value,
          teacher forcing would be used (default is 0.90)

    Returns: output
        - **output** (seq_len, batch_size, num_classes): list of tensors containing
          the outputs of the decoding function.
